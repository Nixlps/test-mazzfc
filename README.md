# MazzFC Test

- The purpose of the test is to validate your technical and organizational skills. It’s not a
big deal if you can’t finish it, we prefer to have an incomplete clean and functional code
than a badly organized and “ugly” code.

- You can use any framework (preferably React) or external resources you need or even
vanilla js, but don’t forget that the goal is to show us your competences.

- All styling has to be done without any external UI library

# Stack

- React
- SASS
- Webpack
- Faker.js 

# Setup

- install all dependencies typing npm install

- start the project and open local web server typing npm start

- build the project for production typing npm build. The dist folder contains all files necessary to go live
